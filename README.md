# Interlace_D3.1

This report is describing the ASIM implementation defined by
Requirements and Architecture Definition D2.1 as well as mechanisms
used to ensure a stable and commonly shared runtime environment in order
to guarantee testability and easy execution of the ASIM-model reflecting
the business logic. Further the code structure will be described and
examined in terms of necessary deviations based on the original ASM
definitions in D2.1. Finally a presentation of the enclosed running environment
is given and elaborated about the future connection to the actual blockchain
driven back end.
