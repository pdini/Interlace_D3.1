\section{Motivation and Objectives of this Report}

The main objective of this report is to present the concepts and steps necessary for the planning, for implementing and for running the ASIM-based demonstrator of the distributed ledger implementation of INTERLACE. In addition, this report provides a coherent view of ICEF/coreASIM and the INTERLACE business logic implementation. It reflects the core architectural decisions made for first demonstrator implementation in a full-stack environment.

Also in this report a refinement process for requirements laid out in D2.1 is pursued for the purpose of prototypical software implementation. These refinements are finally transformed into an ASM specification which can be found in the Appendix \ref{appendix} of this report. This forms the basis for creation of an ICEF-compatible notation for the actual demonstrator implementation.

The main motivation is to demonstrate the viability of the underlying interaction computing approach and to act as a proof-of-concept for the INTERLACE payment specifications.

\section{Scope}

Within the scope of this report, the refinements of business logic specification are derived and provided in a textual description together with helpful illustrations, documentation of the coreASIM implementations is developed, all necessary software products and tools together with its setup are described and the environment created for the use cases is presented.

This report concludes giving guidelines and addressing expected challenges for further development such as testing and increasing stability of the ICEF framework.

However, this report will not deal with a detailed test coverage, nor with the detailed discussion of the achieved outcomes. This part will be documented in deliverable D4.1.
