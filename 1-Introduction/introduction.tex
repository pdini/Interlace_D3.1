\section{Motivation and Objectives of this Report}

The main objective of this report is to present the developed ASIM-model,
demonstrate the viability and acting as a proof-of-concept. Thus to show
that the core architectural decisions made in D2.1 are correct and ready to be
implemented and realized in a full-stack environment.

Additionally the document describes which parts got developed into
the working model and which parts needed to be mocked in order to act as
a replacement for a possible back end structure, as due to different
projects constraints and project board decisions the ASIM-model will
not be developed for the complete back end structure.

\section{Scope}

Within the scope of this report, documentation of the coreASIM implementations
is developed, all necessary software products are described, the environment
created for the use case is presented and a detailed descriptions of updates on the
INTERLACE Business Logic Specification is given.

However, this report will not deal with a detailed test coverage, nor detailed
review of the outcome. This part will be documented in deliverable D4.1.
