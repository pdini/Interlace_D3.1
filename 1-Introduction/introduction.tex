\section{Motivation and Objectives of this Report}

The main objective of this report is to present the developed ASIM-model
and demonstrate the viability model acting as a proof-of-concept. Thus to show
that the core architectural decisions made in D2.1 are correct and ready to be
implemented and realized in a full-stack environment.

Additionally the document describes which parts got developed into
the working model and which parts needed mocked in order to act as
an replacement for a possible back end structure, as due to different
projects constraints and project board decisions the ASIM-model will
not be developed for the complete back end structure.
